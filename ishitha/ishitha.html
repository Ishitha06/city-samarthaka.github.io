            <div class="rule"></div>

            <p>An automated power grid monitoring and control system is a smart infrastructure solution that continuously observes the flow of electricity across the grid and takes automatic actions to maintain stability. It uses sensors, communication networks, and intelligent algorithms to detect faults, balance loads, and optimize energy distribution. Instead of relying on manual checks, the system responds instantly to changes in voltage, current, frequency, or equipment health. <br></p>

            <h3>Wireless Internet tower grid</h3>
            <div class="rule"></div>

            <p>A Wireless Internet Tower Grid is a city-wide system of interconnected communication towers that deliver fast, reliable, and uninterrupted internet coverage. These towers act as digital infrastructure that ensures every home, business, institution, and public space in Samarthaka city has seamless wireless connectivity—supporting education, healthcare, transport, and smart governance.<br>The Wireless Internet Tower Grid for Samarthaka consists of strategically placed communication towers connected through fiber-optic backbones and microwave relay links. Each tower covers a circular or sector-shaped region, forming an overlapping mesh so there are no dead zones.</p>

            <p><b>Building the Communication Backbone: </b>To create a robust, central network backbone that connects all major towers together using the minimum possible total length of high-speed fiber or microwave links, starting construction from a central hub.<br> <br>

            <b>The Algorithm: </b><b>Prim's MST</b> is used to build a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). It starts from an arbitrary "root" tower (perhaps your main data center connection). It then iteratively adds the closest (cheapest connection) neighboring tower that isn't yet part of the backbone. This process repeats until all towers are connected, ensuring the most cost-effective, loop-free backbone structure grows outwards from the center.</p>

            <b>The Algorithm: </b><b>Floyd-Warshall</b> is an "all-pairs shortest path" algorithm. It analyzes the entire network graph and calculates the shortest path between every possible combination of source tower and destination tower. The result is a comprehensive routing table (a matrix) that the network uses to immediately know the best path for any packet, regardless of its entry and exit points in the grid.</p>

The system maintains a table where the "key" is the ID of a specific tower, and the corresponding "value" is the pre-determined backup routing plan for that tower. When a tower failure is detected, the system hashes the failed tower's ID to instantly retrieve its backup route from the table (in O(1) constant time) and re-directs traffic without needing to recalculate the entire network topology.</p>

Because the data is sorted hierarchically, the system can efficiently search for available bandwidth slots, identify top consumers, and reallocate resources to balance the load across different parts of the network.</p>

            <p>The Integrated Waste Management System in Samarthaka uses smart sensors in public dustbins to monitor fill levels in real time. This data is sent to a central control dashboard, where collection routes are dynamically optimized so trucks only visit bins that are actually full. The city is divided into zones, each equipped with waste. <br> A digital tracking system records the journey of waste—from bin to truck to processing center—ensuring complete transparency. Recycling centers use compactors, sorters, and shredders to recover materials, while organic waste is sent to biogas plants or composting sites.

            <p><b>Zone Density Monitoring & Updates: </b>To continuously calculate and update the total number of people present within specific defined zones (like a market square or a street segment) to detect overcrowding instantly.<br> <br>

            <b>The Algorithm: </b><b>Segment tree</b> stores visitor counts in a hierarchical tree structure representing spatial intervals. This allows the system to rapidly update counts as individuals move and instantaneously query the total density over any range of contiguous zones (O(log n)).</p>

            <b>The Algorithm: </b><b>Bellman-Ford</b> calculates the shortest (safest/fastest) paths from a source to various destinations. It is chosen here for its ability to handle complex graphs where edge weights (congestion levels) change dynamically, ensuring that visitors aren't routed into areas where movement has become impossible</p>

             <p>AI-Driven Athlete Performance Analytics helps Samarthaka’s sports academies monitor athletes more intelligently by analysing speed, stamina, reaction time, training patterns, and injury risks. The system collects sensor data, identifies patterns, compares performance over time, and gives personalized improvement suggestions.</p>
